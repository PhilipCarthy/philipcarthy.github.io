# Work in Progress 

## 1. Aircraft Noise and Academic Performance: Evidence from the United States
*With Aisling Reynolds-Feighan and Seán Lyons*

**Abstract:** This paper presents novel evidence of the impact of noise pollution generated at major airports across the United States on the academic performance of students who attend schools nearby. Leveraging data on average academic performance in standardised tests at the school district level from the *Stanford Education Data Archive*, we empirically test the relationship between aircraft noise and local educational attainment. Our identification strategy relies on plausibly exogenous variation in noise generated at airports over time due to the introduction of precision technology-optimised aircraft approach procedures, which are hypothesised to have inadvertently increased noise levels below flight paths. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) data on the implementation of these procedures is used to characterise their staggered roll-out at airports across the United States. The technological development facilitates an investigation of the impacts of noise pollution on local students in a generalised difference-in-differences framework and allows us to disentangle the effects of noise exposure from that of potentially confounding factors such as air pollution. Our results suggest that students in school districts below the flight paths of these new procedures performed worse relative to those in districts with similar airport proximity but which remained unaffected by the new technology.


## 2. Doom and Gloom? The impact of enviromental news on mental health
*With Seraphim Dempsey*

**Abstract:** This paper examines whether environment-related television news broadcasts impact individual-level well-being in the United Kingdom. We empirically assess whether the mental health of participants of Understanding Society, a nationally representative longitudinal study, varies systematically with environment-related news content aired on major national news programmes in the days preceding their survey interview. Relevant news content is identified using quantitative text analysis and recent advances in semi-supervised keyword-assisted topic modelling. The analysis also employs well-validated self-reported mental health measures that require respondents to reflect on their well-being over similarly short time horizons in the lead-up to their survey interview. Identification relies on within-individual variation and is aided by continuously rolling data collection throughout the analysis period: 2014-2019. Our results do not suggest empirical support for the hypothesis that environmental news adversely affects mental health. We also find limited evidence that heterogeneity across socioeconomic or demographic groups masks an effect or that a potential impact is moderated by the overall sentiment of the relevant news broadcasts.
