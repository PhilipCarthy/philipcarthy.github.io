I am a PhD Candidate at the School of Economics, University College Dublin (UCD). My research interests lie at the intersection of environmental economics, health economics, and transport economics. My research seeks to understand the implications environmental externalities and pollution of various forms for health and human captial formation. Before beginning my PhD studies, I was a research assistant at the Economic and Social Research Institute, Dublin, where I contributed to work which formed part of the Institute's Programme of Research in Communications and the Environment Research Programme. I hold a BA in Economics and Mathematical Studies and an MSc in Quantitative Economics, both also awarded by UCD.
